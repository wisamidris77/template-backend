# template-backend

A template you can use for backend made with Go.

## Project Structure

- **main.go**: The entry point of the application. It initializes the database connection, sets up the router, and starts the server.
- **config/database.go**: Contains the logic for connecting to the database and running migrations.
- **config/seeder.go**: Seeds the database with initial data.
- **models/user.go**: Defines the User model and its methods for password hashing and validation.
- **router/router.go**: Sets up the main application routes and middleware.
- **router/dtos/userDto.go**: Defines the data transfer object for the User model.
- **auth/router.go**: Sets up the authentication routes.
- **auth/models.go**: Defines the request and response models for authentication.
- **auth/auth_jwt.go**: Contains the logic for generating and validating JWT tokens and the authentication middleware.

## Disclaimer

This is my first app made in Go, so don't blame me if there is anything bad or wrong. Feel free to contribute and improve the code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `go mod tidy` to install dependencies.
3. Run `go run main.go` to start the server.
4. If you got error like set CGO_ENABLED=1 or something like that just run the init.cmd/init.sh to fix it
5. You should be install gcc because CGO_ENABLED=1 is required by sqlite3 go package and CGO_ENABLED=1 needs gcc
